# Beginner Python Projects 

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects created during my early learning phase as an intern at **VVDN Technologies**. These mini projects helped me practice core Python concepts and explore GUI development using **Tkinter** and **EasyGUI**.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

### 1. `Subprocess/`
Demonstrates how to use Python's `subprocess` module for inter-process communication:

- `program.py`: Runs `test.py` as a subprocess, passes input (`"john"`), and captures its output and return code.
- `test.py`: Receives input, prepends it with `"hello "`, and writes the result to a file (`output.txt`).

This folder highlights basic usage of subprocess management and I/O redirection between Python scripts.

### 2. `Tkinter/`
A collection of practice files that explore GUI components in Python using both **Tkinter** and **EasyGUI**.

- `calculator1.py`, `calculator2.py` & `calculator3.py`
  Basic GUI calculator implementations using **Tkinter**:
  - Handle basic arithmetic operations.
  - Explore widget placement and event handling.

- `easygui.py`
  Demonstrates the use of **EasyGUI** for quick and simple GUI interactions:
  - Message boxes
  - Input fields
  - Button prompts
  - Text editors

- `popup.py`
  Implements a small window with buttons and a popup confirmation using `messagebox.askyesno`.

- `stage.py`
  Simulates a stage-based project evaluation:
  - Asks the user if each stage (1 to 10) is passed.
  - If at least 7 stages are passed, it prints that the project has passed.

### 3. `tic-tac-toe.py`
A console-based implementation of the classic **Tic Tac Toe** game:
- Two-player mode - User vs Computer
- Simple logic for win/tie detection
- Text-based board rendering

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Practiced
- Basic Python programming
- GUI design with Tkinter & EasyGUI
- Event handling
- Simple game logic
- User interaction via dialog boxes

## üìå Note
These projects reflect early explorations into Python and GUI development. They were a great learning ground to build confidence with code structure, UI, and logic flow.
